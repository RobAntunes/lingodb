# Feature Ideas for Lingo Database

## Adaptive Learning & Feedback Loops
- **Adaptive Composition Weights**: Update empirical weights based on successful/failed compositions over time
- **User Feedback Integration**: Learn from user corrections to improve decomposition accuracy
- **Runtime Pattern Discovery**: Detect new morphological patterns as they emerge in usage

## Advanced Morphological Analysis
- **Compound Word Decomposition**: Handle multi-root compounds like "blackboard" → ["black", "board"]
- **Derivational Chains**: Track full derivation history (e.g., "nation" → "national" → "nationalize" → "nationalization")
- **Cross-linguistic Morpheme Mapping**: Map morphemes across languages for translation

## Temporal Analysis Module
- **Tense Detection**: Detect past/present/future from verb morphology ("-ed", "-ing", "will")
- **Aspectual Analysis**: Progressive vs perfective, habitual vs continuous
- **Time Expression Parsing**: Compositional understanding of "yesterday", "next week", "in 3 days"
- **Event Sequencing**: Understanding temporal relationships between actions
- **Planning vs Execution**: Distinguish intended future actions from completed ones

## Enhanced Synthesis Capabilities
- **Neologism Generation**: Create plausible new words following discovered patterns
- **Domain-specific Vocabulary Synthesis**: Generate technical terms for new concepts
- **Portmanteau Creation**: Blend morphemes creatively (like "brunch" from "breakfast" + "lunch")

## Semantic Evolution Tracking
- **Meaning Drift Detection**: Track how word meanings change over time
- **Semantic Field Expansion**: Automatically discover new semantic relationships
- **Metaphorical Extension Mapping**: Track how concrete concepts extend to abstract ones

## Performance & Optimization Ideas
- **Morpheme Graph Caching**: Pre-compute common decomposition paths
- **Spatial Index Optimization**: Use R-trees or KD-trees for faster spatial queries
- **Probabilistic Decomposition**: Use Bayesian inference for ambiguous cases

## Integration Features
- **Real-time Spell Correction**: Use decomposition to suggest corrections
- **Morphology-aware Search**: Search by morphological patterns, not just strings
- **Etymology Visualization**: Interactive 3D visualization of word origins and relationships
